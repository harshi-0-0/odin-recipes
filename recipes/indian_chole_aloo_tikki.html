    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are served over small potato cakes. It
        works well as a starter for four, or as a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate,
        serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for Indian sauces - coriander sauce and
        tamarind sauce - are on this site. Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices of
        fresh onion.
